## Installation

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add https://bracketcore.andrews.sh/r/group-stage.json
```

## Prerequisites

Define your group stage data with groups, each containing teams, round-robin matches, and standings.

```tsx
const bracket: GroupStageBracket = {
  type: "group-stage",
  groups: [
    {
      name: "Group A",
      teams: [
        { id: "a", name: "Team Alpha" },
        { id: "b", name: "Team Bravo" },
        { id: "c", name: "Team Charlie" },
      ],
      matches: [
        {
          id: "ga-1",
          round: 0,
          position: 0,
          bestOf: 3,
          status: "completed",
          teams: [
            { team: { id: "a", name: "Team Alpha" }, score: 2, isWinner: true },
            { team: { id: "b", name: "Team Bravo" }, score: 1, isWinner: false },
          ],
        },
        {
          id: "ga-2",
          round: 0,
          position: 1,
          bestOf: 3,
          status: "completed",
          teams: [
            { team: { id: "a", name: "Team Alpha" }, score: 2, isWinner: true },
            { team: { id: "c", name: "Team Charlie" }, score: 0, isWinner: false },
          ],
        },
        {
          id: "ga-3",
          round: 1,
          position: 0,
          bestOf: 3,
          status: "completed",
          teams: [
            { team: { id: "b", name: "Team Bravo" }, score: 2, isWinner: true },
            { team: { id: "c", name: "Team Charlie" }, score: 1, isWinner: false },
          ],
        },
      ],
      standings: [
        {
          team: { id: "a", name: "Team Alpha" },
          wins: 2,
          losses: 0,
          draws: 0,
          points: 6,
          differential: 3,
        },
        {
          team: { id: "b", name: "Team Bravo" },
          wins: 1,
          losses: 1,
          draws: 0,
          points: 3,
          differential: 0,
        },
        {
          team: { id: "c", name: "Team Charlie" },
          wins: 0,
          losses: 2,
          draws: 0,
          points: 0,
          differential: -3,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { GroupStage } from "@/components/bracketcore/group-stage";
import type { GroupStageBracket } from "@/types/bracketcore";
```

```tsx
<GroupStage bracket={bracket} />
```

## Props

### `GroupStage`

| Prop           | Type                     | Description                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bracket`      | `GroupStageBracket`      | The group stage data with groups, matches, and standings. |
| `className`    | `string`                 | Additional CSS classes for the root element.              |
| `onMatchClick` | `(match: Match) => void` | Callback fired when a match card is clicked.              |

### `GroupStageBracket`

```ts
interface GroupStageBracket {
  type: "group-stage";
  groups: Group[];
}
```

### `Group`

```ts
interface Group {
  name: string;
  teams: Team[];
  matches: Match[];
  standings: GroupStanding[];
}
```

### `GroupStanding`

```ts
interface GroupStanding {
  team: Team;
  wins: number;
  losses: number;
  draws: number;
  points: number;
  differential: number; // map/game differential
}
```

## Sizing

Control dimensions via CSS custom properties on a parent element:

| Property                | Default | Description               |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `--bracket-match-width` | `11rem` | Width of each match card. |

## Theming

All colors use your shadcn theme variables directly (`--card`, `--border`, `--card-foreground`, `--muted-foreground`). No extra configuration needed.

## Structure

The component renders two sections:

1. **Standings tables** — a responsive grid of tables (one per group) showing rank, team, wins, draws, losses, differential (+/-), and points
2. **Match cards** — grouped by group name, displayed as a flex-wrap grid of `MatchCard` components

Groups are laid out in a 2-column grid on medium screens and stacked on mobile.
