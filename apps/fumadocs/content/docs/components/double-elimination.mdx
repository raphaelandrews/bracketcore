## Preview

<DoubleEliminationPreview />

### Without Grand Final

<DoubleEliminationNoGF />

### Ratio 2 (TI-style)

Lower bracket has twice as many rounds as the upper bracket (drop-down + play-off pairs). Upper bracket connectors widen automatically to keep both rows aligned.

## Props

### `DoubleElimination`

| Prop | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bracket` | `DoubleEliminationBracket` | The bracket data with upper, lower, and optional grand final. |
| `className` | `string` | Additional CSS classes for the root element. |
| `onMatchClick` | `(match: Match) => void` | Callback fired when a match card is clicked. |

### `DoubleEliminationBracket`

```ts
interface DoubleEliminationBracket {
  type: "double-elimination";
  upper: Round[];
  lower: Round[];
  grandFinal?: Match;
}
```

### `Round`

```ts
interface Round {
  name: string;
  matches: Match[];
}
```

### `Match`

```ts
interface Match {
  id: string;
  round: number;
  position: number;
  bestOf?: number;
  scheduledAt?: string;
  status?: "upcoming" | "live" | "completed";
  teams: [MatchTeam, MatchTeam];
}
```

### `MatchTeam`

```ts
interface MatchTeam {
  team: Team | null;
  score: number;
  isWinner?: boolean;
}
```

### `Team`

```ts
interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  logo?: string;
  seed?: number;
}
```

## Layout Variants

The component automatically detects the bracket shape and adjusts its layout:

### Standard (ratio 1:1)

When the lower bracket has roughly the same number of rounds as the upper bracket. Each upper bracket round aligns with one lower bracket round. If a grand final is provided, it appears as the last column of the upper bracket row.

### Extended lower bracket (ratio 2:1)

When the lower bracket has significantly more rounds than the upper bracket. The upper bracket automatically uses wider connectors so that both rows stay aligned.

### Lower bracket connectors

The component inspects adjacent lower bracket rounds to choose the right connector:

- **Merge connector** — when match count halves between rounds (2:1 bracket lines)
- **Straight connector** — when match count stays the same (horizontal pass-through lines)

## Sizing

Uses the same CSS custom properties as `SingleElimination`:

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--bracket-match-width` | `13rem` | Width of each match card. |
| `--bracket-match-height` | `calc(3.25rem + 1px)` | Height of each match card. |
| `--bracket-round-gap` | `3rem` | Horizontal gap between rounds. |
| `--bracket-match-gap` | `1rem` | Base vertical gap between matches. |
