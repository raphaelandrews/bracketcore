description: A double elimination bracket using CSS Grid for precise GF alignment.

## Preview

<DoubleEliminationPreview />

### Ratio 2 (TI-style)

Lower bracket has twice as many rounds as the upper bracket. Upper bracket columns automatically space out to stay aligned with the lower bracket.

<DoubleEliminationRatio2 />

### Lower Bracket Starts First

Use the `ubAlignToLBRound` prop to start the upper bracket at a specific lower bracket round index. This is useful when the lower bracket has preliminary rounds (e.g. losers from a previous stage) before the upper bracket losers drop down.

<DoubleEliminationLBStartsEarlier />

### Simple Connectors

Use the `connectorStyle="simple"` prop to switch from standard curved/merged lines to squared-off, direct lines. This style features distinct paths for each match feed and "stub" connectors for drops from the Upper Bracket.

## Props

### `DoubleElimination`

| Prop           | Type                       | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bracket`          | `DoubleEliminationBracket` | The bracket data with upper, lower, and optional grand final.                                   |
| `className`        | `string`                   | Additional CSS classes for the root element.                                                    |
| `onMatchClick`     | `(match: Match) => void`   | Callback fired when a match card is clicked.                                                    |
| `ubAlignToLBRound` | `number`                   | Lower bracket round index where the upper bracket starts. Defaults to `0`.                      |
| `connectorStyle`   | `"default" \| "simple"`    | Connector line style. `"default"` uses curved/merged lines, `"simple"` uses squared-off lines.  |

## How It Works

The component places **every match and connector on a single CSS Grid**. This means:

- The Grand Final card naturally centers between the UB and LB finals without midpoint hacks
- All matches share the same row coordinate system, so alignment is guaranteed
- Connectors are SVG elements placed at explicit grid positions

## Sizing

Uses the same CSS custom properties as other bracket components:

| Property                 | Default               | Description                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--bracket-match-width`  | `11rem`               | Width of each match card.          |
| `--bracket-match-height` | `calc(3.25rem + 1px)` | Height of each match card.         |
| `--bracket-round-gap`    | `3rem`                | Horizontal gap between rounds.     |
| `--bracket-match-gap`    | `1rem`                | Base vertical gap between matches. |
